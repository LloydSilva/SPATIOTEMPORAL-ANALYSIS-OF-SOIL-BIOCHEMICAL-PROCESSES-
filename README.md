# SPATIOTEMPORAL-ANALYSIS-OF-SOIL-BIOCHEMICAL-PROCESSES-
1. Processed and visualized a spatiotemporal dataset using ParaView, analyzing soil biochemical processes (ammonification &amp; nitrification) and ecological factors (plant species &amp; functional types).
2. Advanced Visualization Techniques: Implemented color-coded planes, isolines, isosurfaces, and trend vectors to explore spatial and temporal patterns, including multi-variable representation and animated trends.
3. Key Findings and Insights: Identified seasonal variations in biochemical processes, detected an inverse relationship between ammonification and nitrification, and analyzed species distribution patterns, enhancing ecological understanding through data-driven visualizations.
